# Build Your Own Redis

This is my implementation of Redis from scratch, following the excellent tutorial from [Build Your Own Redis](https://build-your-own.org/redis/01_intro_redis).

## Project Overview

This project is a learning exercise to understand:
1. Network programming fundamentals
2. Data structure implementation and usage
3. How Redis works under the hood

## Tutorial Source

This implementation follows the tutorial series by James Smith at build-your-own.org. The tutorial teaches how to build a Redis server from scratch using C/C++, focusing on:
- In-memory key-value store implementation
- Network programming concepts
- Fundamental data structures

## Getting Started

[Coming soon]

## Acknowledgments
